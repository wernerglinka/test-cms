# Metalsmith Netlify CMS Starter

![](/assets/images/hammer-anvil-blacksmith.png)

This simple site template is intended to help you getting started with building a static site with Metalsmith. The site includes a couple of sample pages and a blog. The site content can be edited with Netlify CMS and is ready to be deployed at Netlify.

The rest is left to your imagination.

See the project page on Github.

Or you can click the button to deploy a copy to Netlify.
